# sparseSpACE - The Sparse Grid Spatially Adaptive Combination Environment

This python projects implements different variants of the spatially adaptive Combination Technique. 
It was first targeted to solve high dimensional numerical integration with the spatially adaptive Combination Technique but it now supports the implementation of arbitrary grid operations.
It will for example soon support solving PDEs and UQ problems.

A short introduction in how to use the framework can be found in the tutorials (see ipynb folder):
- Tutorial.ipynb
- Grid_Tutorial.ipynb
- Extend_Split_Strategy_Tutorial.ipynb

Software requirements:
- python3 (3.5 or higher)
- scipy (1.1.0 or higher)
- numpy
- matplotlib
- ipyton3 (for Tutorials)
- ipython3 notebooks or jupyter notebook (for Tutorials)
- chaospy (for UQ)
- dill (for saving/loading the current state of the refinement to/from a file)

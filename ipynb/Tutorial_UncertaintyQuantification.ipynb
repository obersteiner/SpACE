    "# Uncertainty Quantification Grid Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), a problem function has parameters whose input is not exactly known. Each uncertain input parameter has a probability distribution. When evaluating the function, we can use the expectation as an approximate solution and the variance gives information about how much impact the uncertainty has on the solution. <br/>\n",
    "With the `UncertaintyQuantification` grid operation, it is possible to can calculate moments, expectation and variance, and a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). Input values which are not uncertain need to be fixed in the `Function` object. <br/>\n",
    "The calculations involve weighted integration, where the integrated functions depend on the values which we want to calculate. For example, we can calculate the expectation and variance with the first and second moment:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{E} = \\int_{w \\in \\Omega} f(w) p(w) dw \\\\\n",

    "\\mathrm{Var} = \\mathrm{M}_2 - \\mathrm{E}^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "To reduce the number of problem function evaluations, the adaptive refinement generates a grid which fits well for multiple integrals, for example the first and second moments.\n",

After configuring the grid, the function, and the dimension we need to create the object for the respective strategy (currently we have the $\\textit{SpatiallyAdaptiveFixedScheme}$, the $SpatiallyAdaptiveExtendScheme$, the $SpatiallyAdaptiveCellScheme$ and the  $SpatiallyAdaptiveSingleDimensions$). The different Schemes have different configuration parameters one can choose. For further information have a look in the respective class file. The calling conventions for the spatially adaptive combi slightly differe from those of the standard combis and also include and $errorOperator$ which controls the error estimations and we also have the oportunity to plot the sparse grid and the combination scheme after each refinement step by setting $do\\_plot$ to $true$. In the following we will demonstrate the refinement for to schemes including the respective plots."
